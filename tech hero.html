            <p> Dishanta Kpatrick is a self taught coder who made her way to work at Intuit MailChimp as a front end developer. She started coding in high school through 4-H. When her teacher, Mrs. Smith noticed her potential, and encouraged her to create a website for the local 4-H program. She went to state school after highschool and started to study but ended up not liking it and entering the workforce. </p>
            <p> She was looking for a job when she came across Intuit MailChimp. They were hiring for their Tech Support team. She learned how to code HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and API. She then found that she wanted to create a career in tech, and ended up going to a full-stack web developers boot camp at Georgia Tech. Over six months, she gained the necessary skills. She began to apply for jobs but found that her certificate wasn’t enough. She went back to school for cybersecurity and is currently working on her degree. </p>
            <p> Not even a year later, an  <a href = "https://www.intuit.com/careers/programs/career-pathways/?cid=dis_pocit_clicks_us_eb-media_aw_article-dishanta%7CURM_link%7Cnone_intuit-talent"  target="_blank"> apprenticeship program </a> was started at MailChimp. Out of 50 applicants, only her and 4 others got the placement. That was her journey to engineering. She can be seen as a hero for her untraditional path to tech. Kpatrick shows others who have a non-traditional educational background that they can do it too. </p>

            <h2>Safiya Noble</h2>
            <img src="images/safiya.jpeg" alt="Safiya Noble" width="300">
            <p> One of the top academics, activists, and supporters of equity in technology is Dr. Safiya Noble. She has devoted her professional life to revealing how technology perpetuates and intensifies societal injustices. She is a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and co-founder of the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry (C2i2). By exposing how algorithms and digital platforms reinforce systemic biases against marginalized communities, especially Black women and people of color, her ground-breaking work dispels the idea of technical neutrality. </p>
            <p>Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, written by Dr. Noble, is a landmark work in the fields of digital justice and AI ethics. She painstakingly details how Black women and other oppressed groups are disproportionately misrepresented by search engines like Google, which frequently link them to negative stereotypes. Critical discussions regarding the moral obligations of digital firms and the demand for increased accountability in the development and application of algorithms have been spurred by her research.</p>
            <p>Through her work at the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, Dr. Noble collaborates with scholars, activists, and policymakers to address the intersection of technology, race, and gender. She advocates for a more inclusive and equitable tech industry, emphasizing the importance of centering the voices and experiences of those most affected by digital discrimination. Her efforts have influenced initiatives aimed at dismantling systemic biases in AI and ensuring that technology serves as a tool for justice rather than oppression.</p>
            <p>Dr. Noble's work is revolutionary because it connects scholarly study with practical application.  She offers practical advice for developing a more fair and just IT environment in addition to criticizing the current state of affairs.  She is a modern-day tech hero for her leadership in promoting gender, race, and class equity in the US.</p>

          <p> Born in 2000, George Hofstetter is an American computer programmer, tech entrepreneur, and human rights activist. At the age of 13, he participated in the Qeyno Labs Hackathon in Oakland, California, where his team developed "Connect the Dots," a social network designed to support Black students in predominantly white private schools. This early experience ignited his passion for leveraging technology to address social issues. </p>
          <p>In 2014, Hofstetter and his team created "CopStop," an app aimed at addressing police violence in Oakland. Recognizing the need for systemic change, he founded GHTech Inc. at 16, focusing on helping youth of color enter the tech industry as innovators. Through GHTech Inc., Hofstetter has developed free mobile online curricula, such as UpToCode Academy, to provide accessible tech education. </p>        
          <p>Hofstetter's dedication to social justice and technology has earned him recognition, including the Equal Justice Society's Social Justice Award. He continues to inspire and lead efforts toward a more equitable tech landscape. </p>
