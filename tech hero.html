            <p> Dishanta Kpatrick is a self taught coder who made her way to work at Intuit MailChimp as a front end developer. She started coding in high school through 4-H. When her teacher, Mrs. Smith noticed her potential, and encouraged her to create a website for the local 4-H program. She went to state school after highschool and started to study but ended up not liking it and entering the workforce. </p>
            <p> She was looking for a job when she came across Intuit MailChimp. They were hiring for their Tech Support team. She learned how to code HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and API. She then found that she wanted to create a career in tech, and ended up going to a full-stack web developers boot camp at Georgia Tech. Over six months, she gained the necessary skills. She began to apply for jobs but found that her certificate wasn’t enough. She went back to school for cybersecurity and is currently working on her degree. </p>
            <p> Not even a year later, an  <a href = "https://www.intuit.com/careers/programs/career-pathways/?cid=dis_pocit_clicks_us_eb-media_aw_article-dishanta%7CURM_link%7Cnone_intuit-talent"  target="_blank"> apprenticeship program </a> was started at MailChimp. Out of 50 applicants, only her and 4 others got the placement. That was her journey to engineering. She can be seen as a hero for her untraditional path to tech. Kpatrick shows others who have a non-traditional educational background that they can do it too. </p>

            <img src="images/safiya.jpeg" alt="Safiya Noble">
            <p> Dr. Noble is a professor at UCLA and co-founder of the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry (C2i2), where she actively works to address the ways in which technology reinforces social inequalities. She critiques the assumption that algorithms are neutral and instead highlights how they reflect and perpetuate biases found in society. </p>
            <p> Her research on how search engines disproportionately misrepresent Black women and other marginalized groups has influenced discussions on AI ethics, racial justice in tech, and the accountability of major tech companies.</p>
