    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      For this project, we built a simple web app that can recognize traffic signs using a webcam. We trained a model with Google’s Teachable Machine to identify three types of signs—stop, street, and yield—and then integrated it into a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, it just seemed like a fun, hands-on way to learn about machine learning. But as we tested it more, we started noticing how easily the model could get confused. Things like lighting, camera angle, or even slight differences between signs affected the results. That made us realize how tricky it is for machines to interpret the real world, even when the task seems straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also got us thinking about the bigger picture. In <em>Unmasking AI</em>, Joy Buolamwini talks about how biased data in facial recognition can lead to unfair or inaccurate outcomes. While our project was much smaller in scale, we still saw how important it is to have a diverse and well-balanced dataset. Our model sometimes misread signs simply because it hadn’t seen enough examples from different situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this project gave us a deeper look into how machine learning works—and how much it relies on the data we feed it. Teaching a computer to recognize traffic signs sounds easy, but it turns out there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes.

      <p id="joan" class="description">Hi, I’m Joan Lee. I am from Seoul, Korea but I have lived in multiple countries: Taiwan, and the US. I am pursuing a double major in Information Science and Communication Arts with a minor in Digital Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I’m taking this course to learn web development basics like HTML, CSS, and databases while also understanding race and discrimination in the tech industry. I want to be more aware of biases in technology and how to create inclusive digital spaces.</p>
      <p id="madison" class="description">I’m originally from Milwaukee, WI. I’m a junior studying Information Science. I’m minoring in Digital Studies, Digital Media Analytics, Sports Communication and Graphic Design. This semester in addition to LIS 500 Code and Power I’m taking LIS 472 Introduction to Web Development, LIS 640 Generative AI, JOURN 175 Digital Media Fluency, and ATM OCN 102 Climate Change.</p>
      <p id="ann" class="description">Hi, I’m Ann Teoh from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I am a senior majoring in Information Science with a minor in Digital Studies at UW. I decided to take this course based on a recommendation from a friend who found it interesting. Initially, I enrolled to improve my web development skills, particularly in HTML and CSS. However, as the semester progressed, I found the course even more engaging than I expected. It not only deepens my technical skills but also connects to the ethical implications of technology—particularly how those in power influence technology and how issues of race and discrimination manifest in digital spaces. I want to become more aware of biases in technology and learn how to create more inclusive digital environments.</p>
